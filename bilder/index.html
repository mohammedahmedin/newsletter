            <p class="paragraf1"> This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> -</br>
                another important game guideline.</p>

            <p class="key1">A key driver of youtubability is<strong> the clarity<br> of your gameplay</strong>  to a potential
                player.<br><br>Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the<br> full potential of your game by working
                on<br> getting the<strong> lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your<br> games.<br><br>Many elements can be used to make
                your<br> game clearer<br><br> :For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-<br>raction with the game is
                <strong>evident,</strong> for <br>example, can she<br> tell which character she<strong> controls?</strong> Is<br> the<strong> objective</strong> clear?
                Does it<br> look<strong> fun to play?</strong> Has she<br> understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10<br>
                seconds (too long!).<br><br>Make sure to<strong> use colours</strong> to help indicate indicate<br> the gameplay rules.
                For instance, in Helix<br> Jump, obstacles are<strong> clearly contrasted</strong> (in<br>orange here) and instantly
                recognized as<br> a threat.<br></p>

        <p class="container2-p"> you want to run user tests with f riends and family or even random people in the
            street, it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to
        <strong> understand their</strong> expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.<strong>Make it obvious </strong>with visual
            elements that help<strong> understand the objective and controls</strong> of the game, like with the target used in
            Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to drawing.</p>

        <p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games<strong> on their<br> phone’s Facebook feed,</strong> everything will
            seem smaller than when<br> displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.<strong> You should<br> also
            consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if<br> someone watches iton a small screen.</strong> With an
            average watch time of 3<br> to 5 seconds, this is an<strong> accelerated elevator pitch!</strong><br><br>Think of the moment
            when you decide to click on a random video on<br> YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s
            the same idea<br> for your game videos.</P>
